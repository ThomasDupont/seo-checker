/**
 * The "do simulation" in allows you to write code in a more declarative style, similar to the "do notation" in other programming languages. It provides a way to define variables and perform operations on them using functions like `bind` and `let`.
 *
 * Here's how the do simulation works:
 *
 * 1. Start the do simulation using the `Do` value
 * 2. Within the do simulation scope, you can use the `bind` function to define variables and bind them to `Stream` values
 * 3. You can accumulate multiple `bind` statements to define multiple variables within the scope
 * 4. Inside the do simulation scope, you can also use the `let` function to define variables and bind them to simple values
 *
